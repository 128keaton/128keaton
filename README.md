# Keaton Burleson


My name is Keaton Burleson and I _love_ web development. I excel at frontend/UI design, focusing on user experience.
I have also created a handful of macOS and iOS applications, though none are professionally published.

I work mainly with Angular, but I also have plenty of experience with most NodeJS-based libraries, Svelte(Kit), Spring, Rails, and Symfony
